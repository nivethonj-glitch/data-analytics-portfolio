### 📁 Project 3 –[Flipkart- Customer Service Analysis]
**Goal:**  
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of customer service operations to diagnose the root causes of a high 59% Negative Sentiment Rate, moving beyond surface-level metrics like call duration to find specific operational failures.

### 📁 Project 4 –[Swiggy- Campaign Efficiency & Growth Strategy Data Analysis]
**Goal:**  
To reverse the Paid channel’s conversion drag, we will pivot Maharashtra’s strategy by replacing underperforming seasonal sales with the high-converting Product Launch campaign (82%), specifically targeting mobile users on weekends via the homepage. By scaling these optimizations alongside gains in Karnataka and Telangana, we are effectively reallocating budget from low-yield discounts to high-momentum segments.

**Tools:**  
Tableau

This strategic shift is projected to lift Paid campaign conversion from 43.8% to 48%, eliminating the current 2 percentage point drag on the business's overall conversion rate.
